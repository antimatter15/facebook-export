This is totally distinct from that other facebook exporter, but maybe this one will work briefly in the middle of 2012. This isn't particularly user friendly, mostly it's just for me because at this point I vaguely recognize that it's quite likely that the existence of functional facebook exporters does contribute to the changes Facebook implements in order to further hamper user experience.
